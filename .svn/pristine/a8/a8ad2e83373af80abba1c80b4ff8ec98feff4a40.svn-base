                    <p class="question">Q: What determines whether a merchant falls within a particular rewards category?</p>
                    <p class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> We do not determine how merchants or establishments are classified. Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant code based on the merchantâs primary line of business and the kinds of products and services they sell.</p>
                    <p class="answer">Sometimes a merchant will sell a particular item that appears to fit within the stated qualifying category, but that merchant may not have a merchant code that fits within that category. Therefore purchases with that merchant will not qualify for the stated rewards offer on category purchases. Citi reserves the right to determine which purchases qualify for this offer. Purchases not eligible to receive the additional ThankYou<sup>&reg;</sup> Points include; but are not limited to, purchases made at warehouse clubs, discount stores, department stores and convenience stores.</p>
